       <h2>The original light switch</h2>
       <p>We actually don't know who was the original inventor of the light
       switch was. But rest assured our scholars (AKA Harold) are hard at work
       finding the answer.</p>
       <p>Harold disagrees however, there is more to the history and some people
       stolen the secret and have tried to put this off as their own</p>

       <h2>The inventor of the <em>improved</em> light switch</h2>
       <p>John Henry Holmes created the new and improved design for the light
       switch which is still used to some extent today. He was the inventor of
       the "quick-break technology" that prevented electrical arcing when turning
       the light on and off, drastically increasing the longevity of both the
       switch and the bulb.</p>

       <h2>The abomination that is automated electronic switches</h2>
       <p>Recent "developments" have resulted in the creation of a variety of
       automated systems that dare to replace the usage of traditional light
       switches. Take for example, motion sensor switches. For starters, if you
       hold still in a room for too long, you have to shimmy around until the
       lights come back on. A drastic inconvenience. Furthermore, the remove any
       sense of punctuation that accompanies entering and exiting a room with the
       flick of a light switch. Worse yet are auditory light switches, which turn
       the lights on and off at the clap of your hands. This is outrageous.
       Demanding that a person clap their hands loud enough that the installed
       microphones can hear it can potentially cause palm injuries, one of the
       very same injuries light switches are put in place to avoid.</p>
