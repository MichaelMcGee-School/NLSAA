       <h2>Behind every light is an <em>even greater</em> light switch.</h2>
       <p>Here at the NLSAA we believe that light switches 
       deserve far more recognition than they currently get.
       We would like to start by thanking the great men and
       women who have contributed to the development of this
       great creation. For without it, our lights would either
       be on or off at all moments, forever, either constantly
       wasting power or being pathetically useless.</p>

       <h2>Eliminating the darkness in our world when we <em>really</em> need it.</h2>
       <p>Light switches allow us to illuminate the eternal night
       that consumes all enclosures at a simple flick of the wrist.
       The invention of the light switch has contributed to the
       lessening of personal injuries in dark spaces. However, it 
       leaves the option to keep the lights off either during the day,
       or when we would rather go to sleep, where personal injuries
       are significantly less likely.</p>
